Core Concepts and Techniques:

Multithreading (ThreadPoolExecutor): Parallelizing the image processing tasks to speed up execution.

Data Augmentation: Introducing random image transformations (rotation and flipping) to artificially expand the dataset.

Image Resizing and Normalization: Ensuring uniform size and scaling the pixel values for better performance in deep learning models.

Batch Processing: Processing and saving images in small batches to avoid memory overflows.

How These Help in Machine Learning:

Data Augmentation improves the generalization of the model by exposing it to various transformations of the input data.

Normalization and resizing ensure the images are compatible with the neural networkâ€™s expected input format.

Multithreading increases the efficiency of the data preparation pipeline, especially when dealing with large datasets.

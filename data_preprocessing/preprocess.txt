1. Image Preprocessing (Resizing, Normalization):
Resizing Algorithm:
The code uses PIL.Image.resize() and cv2.resize() to resize images. These functions typically use interpolation techniques such as bilinear interpolation or nearest-neighbor interpolation to resize images.
Bilinear interpolation is a common technique that interpolates pixel values in two directions (horizontally and vertically) to produce a smoother image when resized.
Nearest-neighbor interpolation is a simpler method that assigns the nearest pixel value to the new pixels, which can be less smooth but is computationally faster.
Normalization:
The pixel values of the images are divided by 255.0 to normalize them to a range of [0, 1]. This step is crucial in most machine learning and deep learning models because it ensures that the features (in this case, pixel values) are on a similar scale, which helps the model converge more easily during training.
2. Image Augmentation (if applicable in your use case):
The code provides an optional augmentation function for images. The augmentation involves:
Rotation: The image is randomly rotated by 90, 180, or 270 degrees.
Flipping: The image may be horizontally or vertically flipped. These transformations are a form of data augmentation, commonly used to increase the diversity of the training dataset and help the model generalize better by learning from slightly different versions of the same image.
3. Batch Processing and Multithreading:
Multithreading:
The code uses the ThreadPoolExecutor from Python’s concurrent.futures module to parallelize the preprocessing of multiple images. This improves the performance of preprocessing, especially when handling large datasets.
This isn’t an algorithm, but rather an optimization technique to preprocess images faster by utilizing multiple CPU cores.
4. Handling HDF5 Files:
The code uses the h5py library to load images stored in HDF5 format. This format is commonly used for large datasets, especially when working with scientific data or multidimensional arrays.
No specific machine learning algorithm is applied here, but the code ensures that the data is extracted, normalized, and resized to fit the input requirements of a machine learning model.

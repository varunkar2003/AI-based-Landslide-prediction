Data Information for precipitation

Before download and apply the dataset, please read this text carefully.

-----------------------------climatic variables------------------------------------------
The dataset covers the main terrestrial lands of China (18.2-53.5 N, 73.5-135.0 E).
The total number of grid point is 13,808,747.

The dataset includes monthly total precipitation (pre) from January 1901 to December 2017, which is downscaled from the CRU TS V4.02. The spatial resolution is 0.5 arcminute (approximately 1km).

To reduce the size of NetCDF file, the data is divided in the time dimension with an interval of 3 years. Moreover, the unit of PRE is set as 0.1 mm, respectively, and they are stored using int16 format. Thus, each nc file contains 36 months data; each variable has 39 nc files. 

The nc file name specifically show the data information.
For example, 
pre_1901_1903.nc means ¡°precipitation¡±_¡°beginning year¡±_¡°ending year¡±.nc.

-----------------------------storage space------------------------------------------

The dataset includes 39 NetCDF files.
Each NetCDF file has 2.42 GB of storage space. 
Total storage space with NetCDF format is about 95 GB.

Thus, each NetCDF file was compressed with zip format to reduce the storage space.
Each zip file is about 270 MB.
Total storage space with zip format is about 10.6 GB.
